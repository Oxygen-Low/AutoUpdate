# AutoUpdate
A free to use C++ application that searches for an existing copy of an application, then uninstalls it before extracting a newer version.

Feel free to use in any of your applications, you are WELCOME to provide credits however, you don't have to.
How to implement:
Search for the comment in the code: "//Input the existing folder prefix"
To the left of that, add the prefix to the existing folder with the application.
For example, if your old version is titled "Cool Application Vers 1", it would be "Cool Application" without the version.
Whenever you finish with that, go to the comment: "//Input the new .zip file prefix"
To the left of that, add the prefix to the new .zip file that needs to be installed.
For example, if your new version is titled "Cool Application Vers 2", it would be "Cool Application", like last time.
Once you finish the steps above, compile it, then you can test to see if it works with your program.
